<p>I am Federico Carrone, an entrepreneur working at the intersection of technology, finance, and culture. I created <a href="https://ergodicgroup.com">Ergodic Group</a>, a privately held holding company through which I build and hold companies in distributed systems, cryptography, AI, gaming, infrastructure, and culture. I operate with the conviction that digital infrastructure, capital markets, and cultural production are converging into a single strategic domain, and I focus on long horizon structures where time acts as a filter for quality, judgment, and durability rather than a constraint.</p>

<p>I also created and work at <a href="https://lambdaclass.com">LambdaClass</a>, a software company focused on protocol engineering, systems programming, distributed systems, cryptography and formal verification.</p>

<p>The name Ergodic comes from how I think about time. In ergodic systems, what happens to an individual over time converges with what happens on average. Most systems are not ergodic. The expected value across possible worlds says little about what will happen to you in this one. Path dependence is real. Rationality therefore begins with avoiding ruin and only then with optimization. It means building things that improve through repetition rather than merely endure it.</p>

<p>I think in terms of lived time rather than measured time. Measured time is uniform, divisible, and exchangeable. It is the time of quarterly reports and abstract metrics. Lived time accumulates. Each cycle alters what follows. Learning, judgment, and formation occur only there. When lived time is forced into measured time standards decay and coherence is lost. Much of what I do is an attempt to protect lived time from being flattened into metrics.</p>

<p>I like formal systems. Proofs, type systems, linear types, small verified kernels. I prefer constraints that make entire classes of error impossible to express. I want to work in domains where correctness can be checked rather than argued. At the same time, I am pulled to philosophy that refuses closure. Thinkers who expose assumptions you did not know you were making. I trust rigor when building and ambiguity when thinking.</p>

<p>I believe individuals precede institutions morally. Conscience, judgment, and responsibility are not emergent properties of systems. They are preconditions for legitimate order. Christianity matters to me less as metaphysics than as moral grammar. The claim that dignity is not administered, that responsibility cannot be dissolved into structure. This makes me suspicious of managerial authority that treats people as resources to be optimized, and of ideologies that erase agency in the name of systems.</p>

<p>At the same time, I build systems designed to make individual judgment unnecessary. They assume people will defect if they can and make defection structurally impossible rather than merely punishable. I do not see this as a contradiction. I see it as respect for human nature when building systems that have to work.</p>

<p>I am drawn to difficulty as a filter. Sometimes this sharpens judgment. Sometimes it biases me toward hardness over effectiveness. I am aware of this tension and do not resolve it away. I build, think, and write by holding opposing frames and switching between them depending on what the problem demands.</p>

<p>Ideas matter to me only insofar as they survive contact with reality over time.</p>
