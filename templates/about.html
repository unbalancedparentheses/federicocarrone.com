<section class="about-summary">
  <p>I am Federico Carrone. I grew up in Argentina. You learn early there that money breaks, institutions fail, and the systems people depend on are more fragile than anyone admits. That shaped everything.</p>

  <p>I build companies in distributed systems, cryptography, AI, and programming language design. Right now most of my time goes to Ethereum infrastructure, AI, a new programming language called Concrete, and writing.</p>

  <h2>Main companies</h2>
  <div class="company-card">
    <h3><a href="https://ergodicgroup.com">Ergodic Group</a></h3>
    <p>A privately held holding company through which I build and hold companies in distributed systems, cryptography, AI, gaming, infrastructure, and culture.</p>

  <div class="company-card">
    <h3><a href="https://lambdaclass.com">LambdaClass</a></h3>
    <p>A software company focused on protocol engineering, systems programming, distributed systems, cryptography, and formal verification. We build the infrastructure that others build on.</p>

  <h2>How I think</h2>

  <p>There is a difference between lived time and measured time. Measured time is uniform and exchangeable. Lived time accumulates. Each cycle alters what follows, and learning only happens there. Most of what matters gets lost when lived time is forced into metrics and deadlines. Running companies while believing this is the first contradiction. There are others.</p>

  <p>During the day I work on formal systems, proofs, type systems, verified kernels, domains where correctness can be checked rather than argued. At night I read thinkers who say certainty is impossible. Rigor when building, ambiguity when thinking. I switch between the two more than I blend them.</p>

  <p>Dignity is not administered. Responsibility cannot be dissolved into structure. Individuals precede institutions morally. But the protocols we build are designed to make individual judgment unnecessary. They assume people will defect if they can and make defection structurally impossible. Systems that depend on everyone being good do not work. So we end up building a world that does not need the kind of person worth building it for.</p>

  <p>I read Hayek on decentralized coordination and run a holding company. I write about patience and formation and track AI developments week by week. The company is named after long-run convergence. My own essays argue the long run might not exist anymore. Growing up in Argentina makes you suspicious of both difficulty as a filter and stability as a given. Broken money is not a test of character. It just breaks people.</p>

  <p>Ideas matter only insofar as they survive contact with reality over time.</p>
