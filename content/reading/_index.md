<div class="reading-content">

### Antifragile by Nassim Nicholas Taleb

The central insight is that some systems benefit from volatility and disorder rather than merely surviving them. This reframes how I think about building organizations and making decisions under uncertainty. The distinction between fragile, robust, and antifragile is more useful than any risk management framework I have encountered.

<div class="reading-content">

### Fooled by Randomness by Nassim Nicholas Taleb

My biggest recommendation to crypto founders. Taleb shows how we systematically confuse luck with skill, especially in domains with high randomness. Essential for anyone operating in markets where survivorship bias distorts our understanding of what actually works.

<div class="reading-content">

### The Discourses by Epictetus

A practical manual for distinguishing what is within our control from what is not. Reading it feels like being corrected by someone who has thought more clearly about the same problems you face. The Stoic framework here is less about suppressing emotion and more about directing attention where it can actually matter.

<div class="reading-content">

### The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism by Max Weber

Essential for understanding recent crypto Twitter debates and the cultural foundations of modern capitalism. Weber traces how religious ideas shaped economic behavior, creating a framework that still influences how we think about work, wealth, and moral obligation.

### Inventing the Individual by Larry Siedentop

A history of how Western individualism emerged from Christian thought over centuries. Siedentop challenges the assumption that individualism is a modern invention, tracing its roots to early Christianity and medieval theology. Useful context for understanding debates about consciousness and selfhood.

### Mathematics: Its Content, Methods and Meaning by A.D. Aleksandrov, A.N. Kolmogorov, and M.A. Lavrent'ev

The best introduction to understanding the fundamental laws governing the physical world. Feynman had a gift for making complex ideas accessible without dumbing them down. Reading these lectures fosters both healthy skepticism and justified certainty about how things actually work.

<div class="reading-content">

### The Use of Knowledge in Society by F.A. Hayek

A short essay that explains why decentralized coordination through prices often outperforms central planning. The argument is about information: knowledge is dispersed across millions of minds and cannot be aggregated into a single plan without losing most of what makes it valuable.
