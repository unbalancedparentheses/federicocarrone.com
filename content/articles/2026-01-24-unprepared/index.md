Humanity is completely unprepared for what's coming.

I've been talking with partners, employees, and countless people over the last few weeks. I'm amazed by most people's inability to adapt or even grasp second order effects of what's coming. They don't even want to think about the consequences. Some of the smartest people I've met in my life are trying to avoid accepting the reality: it's very likely we will have tools that are able to do almost everything better than a human in a very short timeline. It's very likely that even those of us who can generally adapt quickly won't be able to overcome this tsunami.

We will experience one of the biggest deflationary shocks in history. Only robotics combined with AI could be bigger than this.

I find it almost absurd to watch so many YouTube channels and X accounts showing you how to create your own simple app or SaaS. If anybody can build things fast, what do you think will happen? Is there demand for thousands of applications of every kind? During the last 20 years some of the smartest people alive battled for attention of people by building software and the limitation was execution costs, speed and distribution.

Right, but I'm forgetting that people say it's not the time of implementation anymore. In theory, we're now in the time of ideas. So what happens when someone has a good idea and anyone can copy it in days?

If implementation becomes worthless, what remains? Perhaps taste, distribution, or maybe in some cases deep domain expertise. But even those moats are eroding fast.

What makes this different from past disruptions is the pace. Previous technological shifts gave people decades to adapt. This one might give them months.

We built this. And yet it feels like it's happening to us, not by us. The strange position of being both the creator and the displaced. This is going to be very sad and fun at the same time. Happy to be alive during this time.
