There's a tension at the heart of systems programming. We want languages expressive enough to build complex systems, yet simple enough to reason about with confidence. We want performance without sacrificing safety. We want the freedom to write low-level code and the guarantees that come from formal verification.

Concrete is an attempt to resolve these tensions through commitment to a single organizing principle: **every design choice must answer the question, can a machine reason about this?**

## On This Specification

This document describes what we're building, not what we've finished building. The kernel formalization in Lean is ongoing work. Until that formalization is complete, this specification likely contains mistakes, ambiguities, and internal contradictions.

We state this not as an apology but as a feature of our approach. Most language specifications accumulate contradictions silently over years, edge cases where the spec says one thing and the implementation does another, or where two parts of the spec conflict in ways nobody noticed. These contradictions become load-bearing bugs that can never be fixed without breaking existing code.

By designing Concrete around a formally verified kernel from the start, we force these contradictions into the open. When we formalize a feature in Lean, the proof assistant will reject inconsistencies. Features that seem reasonable on paper will turn out to be unsound, and we'll have to redesign them. This is the point. We'd rather discover that our linearity rules have a hole *before* a million lines of code depend on the broken behavior.

The specification and the formalization will co-evolve. As we prove properties in Lean, we'll update this document. As we write this document, we'll discover what needs proving. The goal is convergence: eventually, this specification will be a human-readable projection of a machine-checked artifact.

### Stability Promise

The kernel is versioned separately from the surface language. Once the kernel reaches 1.0, it is frozen. New surface features must elaborate to existing kernel constructs. If a feature can't be expressed in the kernel, the feature doesn't ship.

## Design Principles

1. **Pure by default** — Functions without capability annotations are pure: no side effects, no allocation
2. **Explicit capabilities** — All effects tracked in function signatures
3. **Linear by default** — Values consumed exactly once unless marked `Copy`
4. **No hidden control flow** — All function calls, cleanup, and allocation visible in source
5. **Fits in your head** — Small enough for one person to fully understand
6. **LL(1) grammar** — Parseable with single token lookahead, no ambiguity

## The Core Idea

Most languages treat verification as something bolted on after the fact. You write code, then maybe you write tests, maybe you run a linter, maybe you bring in a theorem prover for critical sections. The language itself remains agnostic about provability.

Concrete inverts this relationship. The language is *designed around* a verified core, a small kernel calculus formalized in Lean 4 with mechanically-checked proofs of progress, preservation, linearity soundness, and effect soundness. The surface language exists only to elaborate into this kernel.

### What "Correct" Means

When we say a type-checked program is "correct by construction," we mean correct with respect to specific properties:

- **Memory safety**: no use-after-free, no double-free, no dangling references
- **Resource safety**: linear values consumed exactly once, no leaks
- **Effect correctness**: declared capabilities match actual effects

We do not guarantee termination. Recursive functions may diverge. We do not guarantee liveness or deadlock freedom. These properties are outside the current verification scope. The kernel proves progress (well-typed programs don't get stuck) and preservation (types are maintained during evaluation), which together yield memory and resource safety, not total correctness.

### The Trust Boundary

The kernel type system and its properties are mechanically checked in Lean. What remains trusted: the Lean proof checker itself, the elaborator (surface language to kernel), and the code generator (kernel to machine code). Verifying the elaborator and code generator is future work.

## The Compilation Pipeline

```
Source Code (.concrete)
       ↓
   Lexer/Parser (LL(1) recursive descent)
       ↓
   Surface AST
       ↓
   Elaboration
     - Type checking
     - Linearity checking
     - Capability checking
     - Borrow/region checking
     - Defer insertion points
     - Allocator binding resolution

   Kernel IR (core calculus)
       ↓
   Kernel Checker ← proven sound in Lean

The kernel checkpoint is the semantic gate. Everything before it transforms syntax; everything after it preserves meaning.

## Types

### Primitives

```
Bool
Int, Int8, Int16, Int32, Int64
Uint, Uint8, Uint16, Uint32, Uint64
Float32, Float64
Char, String
Unit
```

### Algebraic Data Types

```
type Option<T> {
    Some(T),
    None
}

type Result<T, E> {
    Ok(T),
    Err(E)
}

type List<T> {
    Nil,
    Cons(T, List<T>)
}
```

### Records

```
type Point {
    x: Float64,
    y: Float64
}
```

### Standard Library Types

For domains where precision matters, the standard library includes:

- **Decimal**: fixed-point decimal arithmetic for financial calculations
- **BigInt**: arbitrary-precision integers
- **BigDecimal**: arbitrary-precision decimals

These avoid floating-point representation errors in financial systems and cryptographic applications.

## Linearity and Copy

All values in Concrete are linear by default. A linear value must be consumed exactly once, not zero times (that's a leak), not twice (that's a double-free). This is closer to Austral's strict linearity than Rust's affine types, which allow values to be dropped without explicit consumption.

Consumption happens when you pass the value to a function that takes ownership, return it, destructure it via pattern matching, or explicitly call `destroy(x)`.

```
fn example!() {
    let f = open("data.txt")
    defer destroy(f)
    let content = read(&f)
    // destroy(f) runs here because of defer
}
```

If `f` isn't consumed on all paths, the program is rejected. If you try to use `f` after moving it, the program is rejected. This is compile-time enforcement, not runtime checking.

### The Copy Marker

Some types escape linear restrictions. The rules for `Copy` are:

1. **Copy is explicit and opt-in.** You must mark a type as `Copy`; it is never inferred.
2. **Copy is structural.** A type can be `Copy` only if all its fields are `Copy`.
3. **Copy types cannot have destructors.** If a type defines `destroy`, it cannot be `Copy`.
4. **Copy types cannot contain linear fields.** A `Copy` record with a `File` field is rejected.

```
type Copy Point {
    x: Float64,
    y: Float64
}
```

The primitive numeric types and `Bool` are built-in `Copy` types. `String` is linear. For generic types, linearity depends on the type parameter: `Option<Int>` is `Copy` because `Int` is; `Option<File>` is linear because `File` is.

`Copy` is not an escape hatch from thinking about resources. It's a marker for types that have no cleanup requirements and can be freely duplicated.

### Destructors

A linear type may define a destructor:

```
type File {
    handle: FileHandle
}

destroy File with(File) {
    close_handle(self.handle)
}
```

The destructor takes ownership of `self`, may require capabilities, and runs exactly once when explicitly invoked. `destroy(x)` is only valid if the type defines a destructor. A type without a destructor must be consumed by moving, returning, or destructuring.

### Defer

The `defer` statement schedules cleanup at scope exit, borrowed directly from Zig and Go:

```
fn process_files!() {
    let f1 = open("a.txt")
    defer destroy(f1)
    
    let f2 = open("b.txt")
    defer destroy(f2)
    
    // When scope exits:
    // 1. destroy(f2) runs
    // 2. destroy(f1) runs
}
```

Multiple `defer` statements execute in reverse order (LIFO). `defer` runs at scope exit including early returns and error propagation.

### Defer Reserves the Value

When a value is scheduled with `defer destroy(x)`, it becomes reserved. The rules:

1. After `defer destroy(x)`, you cannot move `x`
2. After `defer destroy(x)`, you cannot destroy `x` again
3. After `defer destroy(x)`, you cannot `defer destroy(x)` again
4. After `defer destroy(x)`, you cannot create borrows of `x` that might overlap the deferred destruction point

The value is still owned by the current scope until exit, but it is no longer available for use. This prevents double destruction and dangling borrows.

### Abort

Abort is immediate process termination, outside normal control flow. Following Zig's model:

- Out-of-memory conditions trigger abort
- Stack overflow triggers abort  
- Explicit `abort()` terminates immediately
- **Deferred cleanup does not run on abort**

`defer` is for normal control flow, not catastrophic failure. Abort is outside language semantics. The process stops. There are no guarantees about state after abort begins.

## Borrowing

References let you use values without consuming them. Concrete's borrowing model draws from Rust but simplifies it: references exist within lexical regions that bound their lifetime, with no lifetime parameters in function signatures.

```
borrow f as fref in R {
    // fref has type &[File, R]
    // f is unusable in this block
    let len = length(fref)
}
// f is usable again
```

Functions that accept references are generic over the region, but implicitly:

```
fn length<R>(file: &[File, R]) -> Uint {
    ...
}
```

The function cannot store the reference because it cannot name `R` outside the call.

For single-expression borrows, the region is anonymous:

```
let len = length(&f)  // borrows f for just this call
```

### Borrowing Rules

1. While borrowed, the original is unusable
2. Multiple immutable borrows allowed
3. Mutable borrows exclusive: one `&mut T` at a time, no simultaneous `&T`
4. References cannot escape their region
5. Nested borrows of the same owned value forbidden
6. Derived references can't outlive the original's region

Closures cannot capture references if the closure escapes the borrow region. This ensures references never outlive their lexical scope.

## Capabilities

### What Capabilities Are

A capability is a static permission annotation on a function. It declares which effects the function may perform. Capabilities are not runtime values—they cannot be created, passed, stored, or inspected at runtime. They exist only at the type level, checked by the compiler and erased before execution.

Capabilities are predefined names. Users cannot define new capabilities or create composite capability types. Function signatures may combine predefined capabilities using `+` in the `with()` clause, but only among names exported by the platform's capability universe. There is no capability arithmetic, no capability inheritance, no way to forge a capability your caller didn't have.

Capabilities that can be manufactured at runtime aren't capabilities—they're tokens.

### Purity

Concrete is **pure by default**, following Austral's approach to effect tracking. A function without capability annotations cannot perform IO, cannot allocate, cannot mutate external state. It computes a result from its inputs, nothing more.

Purity in Concrete has a precise definition: a function is pure if and only if it declares no capabilities and does not require `Alloc`. Equivalently, purity means an empty capability set.

Pure functions may use stack allocation and compile-time constants—these are not effects. Pure functions may diverge—termination is orthogonal to purity. A non-terminating function that performs no IO and touches no heap is still pure. This separates effect-freedom (what Concrete tracks) from totality (which Concrete does not guarantee).

Purity enables equational reasoning: a pure function called twice with the same arguments yields the same result. Totality would enable stronger claims about program termination, but enforcing it would require restricting recursion, which conflicts with systems programming.

When a function needs effects, it declares them:

```
fn read_file(path: String) with(File) -> String {
    ...
}

fn process_data() with(File, Network, Alloc) -> Result {
    ...
}
```

Capabilities propagate monotonically. If `f` calls `g`, and `g` requires `File`, then `f` must declare `File` too. No implicit granting, no ambient authority. The compiler enforces this transitively.

### The Std Capability

For application entry points, Concrete provides a shorthand. The `!` suffix declares the `Std` capability:

```
fn main!() {
    println("Hello")
}
```

This desugars to `fn main() with(Std)`. `Std` includes file operations, network, clock, environment, random, and allocation, but excludes `Unsafe`.

**Library code should prefer explicit capability lists.** This is a social convention, not a mechanical enforcement. The compiler won't reject a library function that uses `Std`. But explicit capabilities make dependencies auditable. `Std` is a convenience for applications, not a license for libraries.

### Security Model

Capabilities don't sandbox code. If a dependency declares `with(Network)`, it gets network access. What they provide is **auditability**. You can grep for `with(Network)` and find every function that touches the network. You can verify that your JSON parser has no capabilities. You can review dependency updates by diffing capability declarations.

### Capability Polymorphism

Currently, you cannot be generic over capability sets:

```
// Not allowed
fn map<T, U, C>(list: List<T>, f: fn(T) with(C) -> U) with(C) -> List<U>
```

Each capability set must be concrete. This means generic combinators must be duplicated per capability set. Capability polymorphism is future work; the theory is well-understood (effect polymorphism in Koka, Eff, Frank), but adds complexity to the type system and the Lean formalization.

### Parametricity

Generic functions cannot accidentally become effectful depending on instantiation. A function `fn map<T, U>(list: List<T>, f: fn(T) -> U) -> List<U>` is pure regardless of what `T` and `U` are. If `f` requires capabilities, that must be declared in the signature.

Capabilities are checked before monomorphization. When generic code is specialized to concrete types, capability requirements don't change. A pure generic function stays pure at every instantiation.

## Allocation

Allocation deserves special attention because it's often invisible. In most languages, many operations allocate behind your back: string concatenation, collection growth, closure creation.

Concrete treats allocation as a capability, with explicit allocator passing inspired by Zig. Functions that allocate declare `with(Alloc)`. The call site binds which allocator:

```
fn main!() {
    let arena = Arena.new()
    defer arena.deinit()
    
    let list = create_list<Int>() with(Alloc = arena)
    push(&mut list, 42) with(Alloc = arena)
}
```

Inside `with(Alloc)`, the bound allocator propagates through nested calls. At the boundary, you see exactly where allocation happens and which allocator serves it.

Stack allocation does not require `Alloc`:

```
fn example() {
    let x: Int = 42                    // stack
    let arr: [100]Uint8 = zeroed()     // stack
}
```

Allocation-free code is provably allocation-free.

### Allocator Binding Scope

Allocator binding is lexically scoped. A binding applies within the static extent of the call being evaluated and any nested calls that require `with(Alloc)`.

A nested binding may shadow an outer binding:

```
fn outer() with(Alloc) {
    inner()                         // uses outer binding
    inner() with(Alloc = arena2)    // shadows within this call
}
```

Closures capture allocator bindings only if the closure is invoked within the lexical scope where the binding is in effect. If a closure escapes that scope, it cannot rely on an implicit allocator binding and must instead accept an explicit allocator parameter or be rejected by the type checker.

### Allocator Types

```
// General-purpose heap allocator
let gpa = GeneralPurposeAllocator.new()
defer gpa.deinit()

// Arena allocator, free everything at once
let arena = Arena.new(gpa)
defer arena.deinit()

// Fixed buffer allocator, no heap
let buf: [1024]Uint8 = zeroed()
let fba = FixedBufferAllocator.new(&buf)
```

All allocators implement a common `Allocator` trait.

### Allocator Interface

```
trait Allocator {
    fn alloc<T>(&mut self, count: Uint) -> Result<&mut [T], AllocError>
    fn free<T>(&mut self, ptr: &mut [T])
    fn realloc<T>(&mut self, ptr: &mut [T], new_count: Uint) -> Result<&mut [T], AllocError>
}
```

The interface is minimal. `alloc` returns a mutable slice or fails. `free` releases memory. `realloc` resizes in place or relocates. All three take `&mut self`—allocators are stateful resources, not ambient services.

Custom allocators implement this trait. The standard library allocators (`GeneralPurposeAllocator`, `Arena`, `FixedBufferAllocator`) are implementations, not special cases.

## Error Handling

Errors are values, using `Result<T, E>` like Rust and the `?` operator for propagation:

```
fn parse(input: String) -> Result<Config, ParseError> {
    ...
}

fn load_config!() -> Result<Config, Error> {
    let f = open("config.toml")?
    defer destroy(f)
    
    let content = read(&f)
    let config = parse(content)?
    Ok(config)
}
```

The `?` operator propagates errors. When `?` triggers an early return, all `defer` statements in scope run first. Cleanup happens even on error paths.

No exceptions. No panic. Unrecoverable faults (out-of-memory, stack overflow, explicit abort) terminate immediately without running deferred cleanup.

## What You're Giving Up

Concrete is not a general-purpose language. It's for code that must be correct: cryptographic implementations, financial systems, safety-critical software, blockchain infrastructure.

**No garbage collection.** Memory is managed through linear types and explicit destruction. No GC pauses, no unpredictable latency, no hidden memory pressure.

**No implicit control flow.** What you see is what executes. No implicit function calls from operator overloading, no compiler-inserted destructor calls. `defer` statements are explicit: you write them, you see them, even though their execution occurs at scope exit.

**No implicit allocation.** Allocation requires the `Alloc` capability. `grep with(Alloc)` finds every function that might touch the heap.

**No interior mutability.** All mutation flows through `&mut` references. An immutable reference `&T` guarantees immutability, no hidden mutation behind an immutable facade. This forbids patterns like shared caches and memoization behind shared references. If you need a cache, pass `&mut`. If you need lazy initialization, initialize before borrowing. For advanced patterns that genuinely require interior mutability, the standard library provides `UnsafeCell<T>` gated by the `Unsafe` capability.

**No reflection, no eval, no runtime metaprogramming.** All code paths are determined at compile time. There is no way to inspect types at runtime, call methods by name dynamically, or generate code during execution.

If macros are added in a future version, they will be constrained to preserve the "can a machine reason about this?" principle:

- **Hygienic** — no accidental variable capture
- **Phase-separated** — macro expansion completes before type checking
- **Syntactic** — macros transform syntax trees, not strings
- **Capability-tracked** — procedural macros that execute arbitrary code at compile time will require capability annotations, extending effect tracking to the compile-time phase

**No implicit global state.** All global interactions (file system, network, clock, environment) are mediated through capabilities.

**No variable shadowing.** Each variable name is unique within its scope.

**No null.** Optional values use `Option<T>`.

**No undefined behavior in safe code.** Kernel semantics are fully defined and proven sound. The `Unsafe` capability explicitly reintroduces the possibility of undefined behavior for FFI and low-level operations.

**No concurrency primitives.** The language provides no threads, no async/await, no channels. Concurrency is a library concern. This may change, but any future concurrency model must preserve determinism and linearity, likely through structured or deterministic concurrency. This is a design constraint, not an open question.

### Anti-Features Summary

| Concrete does not have | Rationale |
|------------------------|-----------|
| Garbage collection | Predictable latency, explicit resource management |
| Hidden control flow | Auditability, debuggability |
| Hidden allocation | Performance visibility, allocator control |
| Interior mutability | Simple reasoning, verification tractability |
| Reflection / eval | Static analysis, all paths known at compile time |
| Global mutable state | Effect tracking, reproducibility |
| Variable shadowing | Clarity, fewer subtle bugs |
| Null | Type safety via `Option<T>` |
| Exceptions | Errors as values, explicit propagation |
| Implicit conversions | No silent data loss or coercion |
| Function overloading | Except through traits with explicit bounds |
| Uninitialized variables | Memory safety |
| Macros | Undecided; if added, will be hygienic and capability-aware |
| Concurrency primitives | Undecided; must preserve linearity and determinism |
| Undefined behavior (in safe code) | Kernel semantics fully defined |

## Pattern Matching

Exhaustive pattern matching with linear type awareness:

```
fn describe(opt: Option<Int>) -> String {
    match opt {
        Some(n) => format("Got {}", n),
        None => "Nothing"
    }
}
```

Linear types in patterns must be consumed:

```
fn handle!(result: Result<Data, File>) {
    match result {
        Ok(data) => use_data(data),
        Err(f) => destroy(f)
    }
}
```

Borrowing in patterns:

```
fn peek(opt: &Option<Int>) -> Int {
    match opt {
        &Some(n) => n,
        &None => 0
    }
}
```

## Traits

Traits provide bounded polymorphism, similar to Rust's trait system:

```
trait Ord {
    fn compare(&self, other: &Self) -> Ordering
}

trait Show {
    fn show(&self) -> String
}

fn sort<T: Ord>(list: List<T>) with(Alloc) -> List<T> {
    ...
}
```

### Receiver Modes and Linear Types

Trait methods take the receiver in one of three forms:

- `&self` — borrows the value immutably
- `&mut self` — borrows the value mutably
- `self` — takes ownership, consuming the value

If a trait method takes `self`, calling it consumes the value. This follows linear consumption rules:

```
trait Consume {
    fn consume(self)
}

fn use_once<T: Consume>(x: T) {
    x.consume()  // x is consumed here
    // x.consume()  // ERROR: x already consumed
}
```

A trait implementation for a linear type must respect the receiver mode. An `&self` method cannot consume the value. An `&mut self` method cannot let the value escape. A `self` method consumes it.

## Type Inference

Type inference is **local only**. Function signatures must be fully annotated. Inside bodies, local types may be inferred:

```
fn process(data: List<Int>) with(Alloc) -> List<Int> {
    let doubled = map(data, fn(x) { x * 2 })  // inferred
    let filtered = filter(doubled, fn(x) { x > 0 })  // inferred
    filtered
}
```

You can always understand a function's interface without reading its body.

## Modules

```
module FileSystem

public fn open(path: String) with(File) -> Result<File, IOError> {
    ...
}

public fn read<R>(file: &[File, R]) with(File) -> String {
    ...
}

private fn validate(path: String) -> Bool {
    ...
}
```

Visibility is `public` or `private` (default). 

### Capabilities as Public Contract

Capabilities are part of a function's signature and therefore part of the public API contract. Changing the required capability set of a public function is a breaking change. This applies in both directions: adding a capability requirement breaks callers who don't have it; removing one changes the function's guarantees.

When reviewing dependency updates, diff the capability declarations. A library that adds `with(Network)` to a function that previously had none is a significant change, even if the types remain identical.

```
import FileSystem
import FileSystem.{open, read, write}
import FileSystem as FS
```

## Unsafe and FFI

The `Unsafe` capability gates operations the type system cannot verify: foreign function calls, raw pointer operations, type transmutation, inline assembly, and linearity bypasses.

```
fn transmute<T, U>(value: T) with(Unsafe) -> U

fn ptr_read<T>(ptr: Address[T]) with(Unsafe) -> T

fn ptr_write<T>(ptr: Address[T], value: T) with(Unsafe)
```

`Unsafe` propagates through the call graph like any other capability. Grep for `with(Unsafe)` to find all trust boundaries.

### Raw Pointers

Raw pointers exist for FFI and low-level memory manipulation:

```
Address[T]       // raw pointer to T
```

Raw pointers are `Copy`. They carry no lifetime information and no linearity guarantees. This is safe because:

- Creating a raw pointer is safe. `address_of(r)` extracts an address.
- Holding a raw pointer is safe. It's a number.
- Using a raw pointer requires `Unsafe`. Dereference, arithmetic, and casting are gated.

```
fn to_ptr<T>(r: &T) -> Address[T] {
    address_of(r)  // safe
}

fn deref<T>(ptr: Address[T]) with(Unsafe) -> T {
    read_ptr(ptr)  // unsafe: no guarantee ptr is valid
}
```

`Copy` does not imply usable. Raw pointers can be freely duplicated because they carry no guarantees. Safety is enforced at the point of use, not at the point of creation.

### Foreign Functions

Declare foreign functions with `Unsafe` and the `foreign` directive:

```
fn malloc(size: Uint) with(Unsafe) -> Address[Unit] =
    foreign("malloc")

fn free(ptr: Address[Unit]) with(Unsafe) =
    foreign("free")
```

The compiler generates calling convention glue and links the symbol. Foreign signatures are restricted to C-compatible types. Details of the type mapping are deferred to a future FFI specification.

## Implementation

### Determinism

Concrete aims for **bit-for-bit reproducible builds**: same source + same compiler = identical binary. No timestamps, random seeds, or environment-dependent data in output.

For debugging, **deterministic replay**: random generation requires `Random` with explicit seed, system time requires `Clock`. Same inputs produce identical execution.

### The Grammar

LL(1). Every parsing decision with a single token of lookahead. No ambiguity, no backtracking.

This is a permanent design constraint, not an implementation detail. Future language evolution is bounded by what LL(1) can express. We accept this constraint for tooling simplicity and error message quality.

### Compilation Targets

**Native** via MLIR/LLVM, **C** for portability, **WebAssembly** for browser and edge. Cross-compilation is first-class.

### Tooling

Concrete ships with package manager, formatter, linter, test runner, and REPL. Part of the distribution, not external dependencies.

## What You Can Say About Programs

If a program type-checks:

**"This function is pure."** No capabilities declared. No side effects, no IO, no allocation.

**"This resource is used exactly once."** Linear type. No leaks, no double-free, no use-after-free.

**"These are the only effects this code can perform."** Capability set is explicit and complete.

**"This code cannot escape the type system."** Unsafe operations require `with(Unsafe)`.

**"Allocation happens here, using this allocator."** Call site binds the allocator.

**"Cleanup happens here."** `defer destroy(x)` is visible.

**"This build is reproducible."** Same inputs, same binary.

Mechanical guarantees from a type system proven sound in Lean. Not conventions, proofs.

## Example

```
module Main

import FileSystem.{open, read, write}
import Parse.{parse_csv}

fn process_file(input_path: String, output_path: String) with(File, Alloc) -> Result<Unit, Error> {
    let in_file = open(input_path)?
    defer destroy(in_file)
    
    let content = read(&in_file)
    let data = parse_csv(content)?
    let output = transform(&data)
    
    let out_file = open(output_path)?
    defer destroy(out_file)
    
    write(&mut out_file, output)
    Ok(())
}

fn transform(data: &List<Row>) -> String {
    ...
}

fn main!() {
    let arena = Arena.new()
    defer arena.deinit()
    
    match process_file("input.csv", "output.txt") with(Alloc = arena) {
        Ok(()) => println("Done"),
        Err(e) => println("Error: " + e.message())
    }
}
```

Everything is visible: resource acquisition, cleanup scheduling, error propagation, allocator binding.

## Influences

The kernel calculus is formalized in Lean 4. Coq could serve the same role; we chose Lean for its performance and active development.

Austral shaped the type system more than any other language. Linear types in Concrete are strict: every value must be consumed exactly once. Rust's affine types allow dropping values without explicit consumption; we don't. The capability system for effect tracking also comes from Austral.

From Rust: borrowing, traits, error handling, pattern matching. Concrete uses lexical regions instead of lifetime annotations, which simplifies the model but covers fewer cases. `Result<T, E>` and the `?` operator are lifted directly.

Zig's influence shows in explicit allocator passing and defer. Zig functions that allocate take an allocator parameter; Concrete expresses the same idea through `with(Alloc)` and allocator binding at call sites.

Go had defer first. Go also shipped gofmt, which ended style debates by making one canonical format. We ship a formatter too.

The `!` syntax for impure functions comes from Roc. `fn main!()` marks impurity at a glance.

Koka, Eff, and Frank are the algebraic effects languages. Concrete's capabilities are a simplified version of their effect systems. Capability polymorphism would bring us closer to their expressiveness; it's future work.

Haskell proved that pure-by-default is practical. Clean had uniqueness types (precursor to linear types) and purity before Haskell did.

Cyclone pioneered region-based memory, the research line that led to Rust's lifetimes and our lexical regions. ATS showed linear types and theorem proving can coexist. Ada/SPARK proved formal verification works in production: avionics, rail, security-critical systems.

CompCert and seL4 established that you can mechanically verify real systems software. A verified C compiler and a verified microkernel. That's the standard we're aiming for.

These ideas work. We're combining them and proving the combination sound.

## Who Should Use This

Concrete trades convenience for explicitness, flexibility for auditability. Prototyping is slower. Some patterns become verbose. You'll miss interior mutability for certain data structures.

But for cryptographic primitives, consensus protocols, financial transaction systems, medical device firmware, the trade is worth it. Strong claims about program behavior, mechanically verified.

A language you can trust the way you trust mathematics: not because someone promises it works, but because you can check the proof.

## Quick Reference

| Annotation | Meaning |
|------------|---------|
| `fn foo() -> T` | Pure function, no capabilities |
| `fn foo!() -> T` | Shorthand for `with(Std)` |
| `fn foo() with(C) -> T` | Requires capability set `C` |
| `with(Alloc)` | Function may allocate |
| `with(Alloc = a)` | Bind allocator `a` at call site |
| `T` | Linear type, consumed exactly once |
| `type Copy T` | Unrestricted type, freely duplicated |
| `&T` or `&[T, R]` | Immutable reference in region `R` |
| `&mut T` | Mutable reference |
| `Address[T]` | Raw pointer (unsafe to use) |
| `borrow x as y in R { }` | Explicit borrow with named region |
| `defer expr` | Run `expr` at scope exit |
| `destroy(x)` | Consume via destructor |
| `foreign("symbol")` | Foreign function binding |

---

## Appendix A: Standard Capabilities

The `Std` capability (accessed via `!`) bundles these individual capabilities:

| Capability | Gates |
|------------|-------|
| `File` | Open, read, write, close files. Directory operations. |
| `Network` | Sockets, HTTP, DNS resolution. |
| `Alloc` | Heap allocation. Requires allocator binding at call site. |
| `Clock` | System time, monotonic time, sleep. |
| `Random` | Random number generation. Requires explicit seed for reproducibility. |
| `Env` | Environment variables, command line arguments. |
| `Process` | Spawn processes, exit codes, signals. |
| `Console` | Stdin, stdout, stderr. |

Capabilities not in `Std`:

| Capability | Gates |
|------------|-------|
| `Unsafe` | Raw pointer operations, FFI calls, transmute, inline assembly. Never implicit. |

A function with no capability annotation is pure. A function with `!` has access to everything except `Unsafe`. A function with explicit `with(File, Alloc)` has exactly those capabilities.

Capabilities are not hierarchical. `Std` is a shorthand for a set, not a super-capability. You cannot request "half of Std."

---

## Appendix B: Open Questions

These are unresolved design decisions:

**Concurrency**

No concurrency primitives exist. The language is currently single-threaded. Any future model must preserve:
- Linearity (no data races from aliasing)
- Determinism (reproducible execution)
- Effect tracking (concurrency as capability)

Candidates: structured concurrency (like Trio/libdill), deterministic parallelism (like Haskell's `par`), actor model with linear message passing. Not decided.

**Capability Polymorphism**

Currently impossible:
```
fn map<T, U, C>(list: List<T>, f: fn(T) with(C) -> U) with(C) -> List<U>
```

This forces duplicating combinators for each capability set. The theory exists (Koka, Eff, Frank), but adds complexity. Open question: is the duplication acceptable, or do we need polymorphism?

**Effect Handlers**

Capabilities track effects but don't handle them. Full algebraic effects would allow:
```
fn with_mock_filesystem<T>(f: fn() with(File) -> T) -> T {
    handle File in f() {
        open(path) => resume(MockFile.new(path))
        read(file) => resume(mock_data)
    }
}
```

This enables testing, sandboxing, effect interception. Significant implementation complexity. Not committed.

**Module System**

Current design is minimal. Open questions:
- Parameterized modules (functors)?
- Module-level capability restrictions?
- Visibility modifiers beyond public/private?
- Separate compilation units?

**FFI Type Mapping**

The spec says "C-compatible types" without defining them. Need to specify:
- Integer mappings (is `Int` C's `int` or `intptr_t`?)
- Struct layout guarantees
- Calling conventions
- Nullable pointer representation
- String encoding at boundaries

**Variance**

Generic types have variance implications. `List<T>` is covariant in `T`. `fn(T) -> U` is contravariant in `T`. The spec doesn't address this. For linear types, variance interacts with consumption. Needs formalization.

**Macros**

No macro system. Options:
- None (keep it simple)
- Hygienic macros (Scheme-style)
- Procedural macros (Rust-style)
- Compile-time evaluation (Zig-style comptime)

Procedural macros would need capability restrictions. Not decided.

---

## Appendix C: Glossary

**Affine type**: A type whose values can be used at most once. Rust's ownership model is affine: you can drop a value without consuming it.

**Capability**: A token that grants permission to perform an effect. Functions declare required capabilities; callers must have them. Capabilities propagate: if `f` calls `g`, and `g` needs `File`, then `f` needs `File`.

**Consumption**: Using a linear value in a way that fulfills its "exactly once" obligation. Methods of consumption: pass to a function taking ownership, return, destructure via pattern match, call `destroy()`.

**Copy type**: A type exempt from linearity. Values can be duplicated freely. Must be explicitly marked. Cannot have destructors or linear fields.

**Destruction**: Consuming a linear value by invoking its destructor. `destroy(x)` calls the type's destructor and consumes `x`.

**Effect**: An observable interaction with the world outside pure computation: IO, allocation, mutation, non-determinism. Concrete tracks effects through capabilities.

**Elaboration**: The compiler phase that transforms surface syntax into kernel IR. Type checking, linearity checking, and capability checking happen here.

**Kernel**: The core calculus formalized in Lean. A small language with mechanically verified properties. The surface language elaborates into it.

**Lexical region**: A scope that bounds reference lifetimes. References created in a region cannot escape it. Unlike Rust's lifetime parameters, regions are always lexical and never appear in signatures.

**Linear type**: A type whose values must be used exactly once. Not zero (leak), not twice (double-use). Concrete's default.

**Purity**: Absence of effects. A pure function computes a result from its inputs without IO, allocation, or mutation. In Concrete, functions without capability annotations are pure.

**Raw pointer**: An `Address[T]` value. Carries no lifetime or linearity information. Safe to create and hold; unsafe to use.

**Reference**: A borrowed view of a value. `&T` for immutable, `&mut T` for mutable. The original value is inaccessible while borrowed.

**Region**: See lexical region.

**Std**: The standard capability set. Shorthand for `File`, `Network`, `Alloc`, `Clock`, `Random`, `Env`, `Process`, `Console`. Excludes `Unsafe`.

**Unsafe**: The capability that permits operations the type system cannot verify: FFI, raw pointer dereference, transmute.
