          <description xml:base="https://federicocarrone.com/articles/notes-on-culture-infrastructure-time-and-ergodicity/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ergodicgroup.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Ergodic Group&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is organized around the observation that certain systems change character through sustained engagement. In these systems, repetition refines execution, experience carries forward, and accumulated judgment reshapes future outcomes. Time is not neutral. It filters error, stabilizes standards, and reveals structural quality. Systems differ less in what they produce than in how they behave under repeated contact with reality.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contemporary society is accelerating across technical, cultural, and organizational dimensions. Cycles shorten, signals multiply, and coordination occurs under constant pressure to respond. This acceleration compounds itself, tightening feedback loops and compressing decision horizons. As pace increases, many structures continue operating while gradually shedding accumulated judgment and internal coherence. Activity persists while formation weakens. Systems appear functional even as their capacity to learn erodes.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acceleration also alters the shape of error and transmission. As pace increases, decisions become harder to reverse while feedback quality declines. Irreversibility moves upstream. Early mistakes remain cheap only briefly, after which correction costs rise sharply. At the same time, what spreads fastest diverges from what works best. Forms that replicate quickly outperform those that behave correctly under repetition. Compression, legibility, and ease of copying dominate transmission while durability becomes harder to observe. Imitation spreads faster than learning. What circulates most widely is rarely what compounds judgment over time.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acceleration operates as a selection mechanism at two levels. At the level of individual systems, time reveals whether repetition compounds judgment or merely increases exposure. At the level of entire sectors, time reveals which categories can sustain formation under continuous acceleration. Most cannot. Sectors that depend on local advantage, fragile differentiation, or temporary coordination tend to fragment, commoditize, or disappear rather than evolve.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acceleration often produces less transformation than it promises. Tools change rapidly while underlying constraints remain intact. Activity increases even as structural novelty diminishes. What presents itself as innovation is often the rapid circulation of forms rather than a reconfiguration of fundamentals.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under these conditions, endurance becomes informative. Systems that continue to behave correctly across long spans of stress and variation reveal alignment between structure, incentives, and reality. Continued correctness functions as a diagnostic signal. Duration matters because few systems remain exposed long enough for time to test them. What matters is how behavior evolves under repetition.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The internet did not dissolve coherence. It revealed texture that homogeneity had previously concealed. What once appeared uniform now resolves into distinct patterns of intention, execution, and quality. As distribution becomes universal, distinction reemerges through fidelity rather than availability. Abundance exposes superficiality. Depth becomes legible through sustained correctness rather than momentary visibility.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;two-forms-of-time&quot;&gt;Two forms of time&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time operates in human systems in two fundamentally different ways.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measured time is divisible and uniform. It is organized into intervals and governs schedules, deadlines, accounting periods, and discounting. It can be allocated, optimized, compressed, and exchanged. Planning systems and evaluation frameworks operate within measured time, assuming that value can be assessed independently of history.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lived time is accumulative and qualitative. It is shaped by what occurs within it. Learning, memory, and judgment develop through lived time. Each cycle alters what follows. Later moments differ in kind from earlier ones because experience reshapes perception, attention, and capacity.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Processes that depend on formation operate in lived time. Each cycle changes the character of subsequent cycles. Experience accumulates rather than repeating identically. What is learned reshapes what becomes possible. These processes cannot be evaluated correctly through snapshots because their value emerges through accumulation rather than momentary performance.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Systems organized entirely around measured time assume that intervals are interchangeable. This assumption holds only where repetition does not change outcomes and exposure does not reshape capability.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When lived time is forced into measured time, formation fails. Standards cannot stabilize. Judgment cannot compound. The information produced by evaluation becomes distorted because it ignores history.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time reveals what a system actually is. Structure becomes legible through sustained activity. What appears coherent early may fail under variation, load, or shifting incentives. What endures across repeated contact with reality discloses properties that cannot be inferred in advance. Continued correctness produces evidence rather than claims.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;formation-under-constraint&quot;&gt;Formation under constraint&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excellence emerges from sustained practice under appropriate constraints. Athletic, artistic, intellectual, and technical achievement follow this pattern. Initial talent offers limited advantage relative to disciplined engagement over extended periods of formation.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Practice systems depend on complete cycles of effort, feedback, and adjustment. When these cycles are interrupted or prematurely evaluated, formation stalls. Learning fragments. Standards decay.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Errors must remain survivable for learning to occur. Adjustment must be possible without each iteration becoming terminal. Judgment improves only when experience accumulates across attempts rather than being truncated by constant resetting.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When systems optimize for immediate measurement, necessary errors are avoided rather than integrated. Practices converge toward forms that appear legible early yet fail under prolonged stress. The effort required to maintain genuine standards becomes unsustainable under continuous pressure for immediate results.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capital structures that impose fixed evaluation windows reinforce this dynamic. When outcomes must be made legible on predetermined schedules, decisions orient toward transferability rather than structural soundness. Systems develop according to measurement regimes rather than their own requirements for formation. Failure is deferred and rendered less visible.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Practices generate two kinds of value. External value appears outside the practice through money, status, and recognition. Internal value emerges only through the practice itself, through excellence inseparable from the process that produced it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When structures privilege rapid extraction of external value, internal value formation is displaced. Standards that require time to stabilize are abandoned in favor of standards that generate immediate signals. What the practice uniquely develops is replaced by what can be transferred quickly.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;four-domains&quot;&gt;Four domains&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The work of Ergodic Group unfolds across four interdependent domains: mathematics, code, culture, and craft. These domains describe a group level system through which abstract structure becomes operative reality and through which reality reshapes future abstraction. Individual companies typically operate primarily within one domain. Advantage emerges through connection rather than internal completeness.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mathematics establishes structure and constraint. It defines relationships that remain valid as complexity increases. Mathematical coherence preserves alignment under transformation. A formula outlives its creator, becoming compressed truth that compounds through reuse.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Code translates structure into execution. It transforms logic into process, protocol, and system. Code brings abstraction into contact with reality through systems that must operate under stress. Over time, clarity and precision determine whether systems converge toward reliability or degrade under pressure.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Culture coordinates meaning across time and participation. It encodes standards and shared understanding that allow intent to persist as participants change. Culture resists flattening under acceleration by preserving depth, taste, and judgment.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Craft grounds abstraction through execution. It expresses standards in material reality, where precision and care impose irreversible costs. Materials resist. Execution reveals flaws. Craft encodes time, place, and skill into forms that can be shared.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These domains form a continuous loop across the group. Insight emerges from confronting execution with constraint. Standards stabilize through repetition. Precision advances through accumulated understanding. Learning compounds only when domains remain connected.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What persists across time does so through specific mechanisms: algorithmic logic that can be re-implemented, textual knowledge that can be recopied, cultural practices that can be retransmitted, material techniques that can be relearned. These domains describe how structure, meaning, and capability transfer across generations when connected rather than isolated.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;ergodicity-as-a-filter&quot;&gt;Ergodicity as a filter&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ergodicity describes when repetition improves typical outcomes. In ergodic processes, learning transfers, experience accumulates, and later decisions benefit from earlier cycles. Competence compounds.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where repetition strengthens judgment, time improves performance. Where outcomes fail to converge, time increases exposure without increasing capability. Ergodicity functions as a selection filter, indicating whether a system benefits from continued operation or is gradually revealed as fragile.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under accelerating conditions, this filter concentrates value. Many sectors fragment and disappear as coordination costs rise and memory collapses. What remains are systems that preserve coherence under exposure.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infrastructure and culture persist under this pressure because they function as environments rather than sectors. Infrastructure coordinates action through rules and constraints that must hold under stress. Each correct operation adds evidence of reliability. Culture coordinates meaning through sustained production. Standards accumulate. Direction persists.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both absorb volatility and convert continuity into capability. Operational history becomes evidence. Coherence becomes legible. Time becomes an asset where learning transfers. They persist because they institutionalize maintenance rather than novelty, embedding accumulated judgment into structure and practice even when maintenance remains invisible to the market.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;operation&quot;&gt;Operation&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ergodic Group is organized around this understanding. Time is treated as an information process. Companies are built or acquired primarily within one domain. Advantage is created by connecting them so that learning, standards, and constraints transfer across domains rather than remaining isolated.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This understanding shapes operation. Loop integrity is maintained across transitions. Formation is allowed to occur in lived time rather than being forced into measured time. Attention concentrates on domains where repetition produces compounding advantage and where connection strengthens performance.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those domains win with time.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <title>The new financial backend of the world</title>

          <description xml:base="https://federicocarrone.com/series/ethereum/the-new-financial-backend-of-the-world/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By Federico Carrone and Roberto Catalan&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ethereum is emerging as a general purpose financial backend that reduces the cost and complexity of building financial services while improving their speed and security. For decades the internet accelerated communication but did not create a neutral system for defining ownership or enforcing obligations. Economic activity moved online without the accompanying machinery of rights, records, and jurisdiction. Ethereum fills this gap by embedding these functions in software and enforcing them through a distributed validator set.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Markets depend on property rights, and property rights depend on reliable systems for recording ownership, supporting transfer, and enforcing obligations. Prices then communicate scarcity and preference, enabling coordination at scale. Technological progress has repeatedly lowered the cost of transmitting information and synchronizing action. Ethereum extends this pattern by lowering the cost of establishing and verifying ownership across borders.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;from-internet-native-to-global-infrastructure&quot;&gt;From internet native to global infrastructure&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ethereum’s early innovation was the introduction of programmable digital assets with defined economic properties. Issuers could establish monetary rules, engineer scarcity, and integrate assets into applications. Before Ethereum, such experimentation required constructing a  network and persuading others to secure it, a process limited to technically sophisticated groups. Ethereum replaced infrastructure duplication with shared security and a general purpose environment, turning issuance from a capital intensive undertaking into a software driven activity.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more consequential development has been the recognition that Ethereum can reconstruct traditional financial services in a form that is more transparent and less operationally burdensome. Financial institutions devote substantial resources to authorization, accounting, monitoring, dispute resolution, and reporting. Consumer interfaces sit atop complex internal systems designed to prevent error and misconduct. Ethereum substitutes a portion of this apparatus with a shared ledger, a programmable execution environment, and cryptographic enforcement. Administrative complexity is reduced because core functions are delegated to software rather than replicated within each institution.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ethereum reduces that burden by providing a shared ledger with real time updates, a programmable space for defining rules, and cryptographic enforcement. It does not remove institutions but changes which parts of the financial stack they must build themselves. Issuance becomes simpler, custody more secure, and administration less dependent on proprietary infrastructure.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;software-trust-and-the-reduction-of-friction&quot;&gt;Software, trust and the reduction of friction&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some economists describe transaction costs through three frictions: triangulation, transfer and trust. Triangulation concerns how economic actors identify each other and agree on terms. Transfer concerns how value moves between them. Trust concerns the enforcement of obligations. Traditional financial architecture manages these frictions through scale, proprietary systems, and coordination among intermediaries.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ethereum remove middlemen and therefore lowers the three frictions enumerated before. Open marketplaces support discovery of assets and prices. Digital value can settle globally within minutes without the layers of correspondent banking. Obligations can be executed automatically and verified publicly. These capabilities do not eliminate institutional functions but shift part of the work from organizations to software, reducing cost and operational risk.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New entrants benefit immediately. They can rely on infrastructure maintained by thousands of engineers rather than building their own systems for settlement, custody, and enforcement. Business logic becomes code. Obligations can be automated. Settlement becomes immediate. Users retain custody. This expands the range of viable business models and allows firms to serve markets that incumbents consider too small or too complex.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having a single global ledger also changes operational dynamics. Many institutions operate multiple databases that require frequent reconciliation and remain vulnerable to error. Ethereum maintains a continuously updated and replicated record that cannot be amended retroactively. Redundancy and recoverability become default properties rather than costly internal functions.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Security follows the same pattern. Instead of defending a central database, Ethereum distributes verification among many independent actors. Altering history requires coordination at scale and becomes prohibitively expensive. Confidence arises from system design rather than institutional promises.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;new-financial-services-and-global-reach&quot;&gt;New financial services and global reach&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These features enable services that resemble established financial activities but operate with different cost structures. International transfers can use digital dollars rather than correspondent networks. Loans can enforce collateral rules in code. Local payment systems can interoperate without proprietary standards. Individuals in unstable economies can store value in digital instruments independent of local monetary fragility.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearing, custody, reconciliation, monitoring, and enforcement shift from organizational processes into shared software. Companies can focus on product design and distribution rather than maintaining complex internal infrastructure. Scale is achieved by acquiring users, because infrastructure is shared. Value accrues to applications rather than to duplicated internal systems.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The impact is most visible in markets with fragile financial systems. In economies with unstable currencies or slow payment networks, Ethereum provides immediate functional gains. In developed markets the benefits appear incremental but accumulate as more instruments and processes become programmable.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;institutional-transformation-and-long-term-dynamics&quot;&gt;Institutional transformation and long term dynamics&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many financial instruments are heterogeneous. Corporate debt is a clear example. Terms differ by maturity, coupon, covenants, collateral, and risk. Trading depends on bilateral negotiation and intermediaries who maintain records and enforce obligations. Ethereum can represent these instruments digitally, track ownership, and execute terms automatically. Contracts retain their specificity, while administration becomes standardized and interoperable.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This suggests a shift in institutional architecture. Regulation and legal systems remain central, but the boundary between what firms must build and what software can enforce changes. Institutions evolve from infrastructure providers to service designers. Cost structures diverge between firms that maintain legacy systems and those that rely on shared infrastructure.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ethereum already functions as an alternative financial rail. Its reliability, the presence of multiple independently developed clients, substantial real world usage, active research community, and commitment to openness and verification distinguish it from other blockchain networks. These qualities align with the requirements of durable financial infrastructure.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ethereum converts core financial frictions into software functions. This changes the economics of building and operating financial services. Talent and capital shift from operations to innovation in product design. Institutions become lighter and more focused. Those who will adopt Ethereum will have lower costs of operation and will have a head start against competitors.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technological transitions begin in niches where incumbents do not meet demand. As systems mature, costs fall and broader adoption becomes feasible. Ethereum followed this path. It began with internet native communities, expanded across emerging markets where users lacked reliable financial tools, and is now positioned to upgrade mainstream markets by making financial companies easier to create and operate.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The broader implication is that software is becoming the organizing principle of financial infrastructure. Ethereum makes this shift concrete. Whether it becomes foundational will depend on regulation and institutional adaptation, but the economic incentives are increasingly aligned with systems that are open, verifiable, and resilient.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <title>The missing institution of the Internet</title>
          <pubDate>Tue, 02 Dec 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

          <guid>https://federicocarrone.com/series/ethereum/the-missing-institution-of-the-internet/</guid>
          <description xml:base="https://federicocarrone.com/series/ethereum/the-missing-institution-of-the-internet/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By Federico Carrone and Roberto Catalan&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern economic systems rest on two foundations: tools that expand productive capacity and institutions that define who controls their output. The internet transformed how information moves, but it did not reconstruct the institutional machinery that governs ownership and exchange. Digital economic life therefore expanded without a durable system of rights, enforcement, or jurisdiction. Blockchain networks, and Ethereum in particular, address this gap by embedding institutional functions in software and enforcing them through economic incentives and cryptographic verification.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;technology-culture-and-institutional-design&quot;&gt;Technology, Culture and Institutional Design&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In most species, behavior is shaped by biology and fixed through genetic inheritance. Humans diverged by inventing technologies that alter their environment more rapidly than biological evolution can adapt to it. Fire, agriculture, medicine and computing enabled a physically vulnerable species to extend its productive frontiers.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equally significant was the emergence of institutions that facilitated cooperation beyond small groups. Human societies are organized not through inherited instinct but through constructed systems of norms, laws and symbolic abstractions that can be revised in response to changing conditions. Cultural evolution permits continuous redesign and operates on a faster timescale than genetic change.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This dual process, technological augmentation and institutional invention, generated compounding effects. Tools expanded individual capacity and institutions aggregated that capacity into collective action. Property rights, contracts, markets and corporate entities emerged as mechanisms to coordinate behavior at scale by defining entitlements and aligning incentives.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;property-rights-and-markets-as-social-technologies&quot;&gt;Property Rights and Markets as Social Technologies&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Economic development depends not only on productive capability but on credible commitments. Individuals and firms invest when they can expect to benefit from their efforts and be protected from arbitrary interference. Property rights provide that assurance by specifying ownership, use and exclusion. Markets, layered on top of these rights, coordinate production and exchange by allocating resources through price signals.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These arrangements are often treated as natural features of economic life. They are engineered agreements constructed through law and political settlement. Their value lies in enabling investment, specialization and trade under uncertainty. Prices, money and contracts compress information about scarcity, preferences and risk, enabling production to be coordinated across large populations without centralized direction.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The global expansion of trade in the twentieth century reflected these institutional foundations. Specialization increased productivity and interdependence reduced conflict by raising the cost of disruption. Innovations such as neutral jurisdictions and corporate structures enabled strangers to transact under shared rules. Legal entities functioned as containers that allowed participants from different regulatory environments to collaborate.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This infrastructure, whether admired or criticized, underwrote the international economic order of the late twentieth century.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-missing-architecture-of-digital-ownership&quot;&gt;The Missing Architecture of Digital Ownership&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The internet lowered the cost of communication and commerce across borders, but it did not establish a neutral mechanism for defining and enforcing claims on digital assets. Offline, ownership is adjudicated by courts, enforced by states and geographically bounded. Online, in the absence of a global authority, ownership defaults to either national legal systems or to the platforms that mediate activity.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corporations filled this vacuum by providing infrastructure for identity, communication and exchange. They set terms of access, mediate transactions and retain discretionary control over assets generated within their systems. Users and firms may create content, build businesses and accumulate value, but their rights are contingent on the policies of the platform operator.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The experience of Zynga illustrates this dynamic. The company developed a profitable games business on Facebook and briefly achieved a valuation exceeding that of Electronic Arts. Its fortunes deteriorated when Facebook revised its policies and altered its revenue share. Zynga owned its intellectual property and its infrastructure but not the environment on which its business model depended, a common position for firms built on platform economies. In digital markets, platforms function as de facto landlords.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not an isolated case but a structural feature of platform centered economies: extensive participation paired with limited control.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;ethereum-as-an-institutional-experiment&quot;&gt;Ethereum as an Institutional Experiment&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ethereum is a response to this institutional absence. It provides a mechanism for creating, transferring and enforcing digital assets without reliance on corporate or national intermediaries. The system operates as a verifiable computing environment in which rules are encoded in software and enforced collectively by a distributed network.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditional computing systems require users to trust the operator. Ethereum distributes computation across thousands of machines that execute identical code and verify each other in a continuous process. Outputs are accepted when consensus is reached and misbehavior is economically penalized. Under these conditions, property rights and contractual commitments can be represented as digital objects whose enforcement does not depend on courts or discretionary authority.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This architecture automates functions normally performed by institutions. Auditors repeat financial records to detect manipulation. Courts resolve disputes. Regulators impose compliance standards. These systems are essential but costly and slow. Ethereum replicates aspects of verification and enforcement at the system level using software, mathematics and economic incentives.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The network is open to participation without authorization and resistant to censorship because no single entity can unilaterally block or rewrite transactions. These properties arise from the structure of the system rather than ideological intent.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-emergence-of-a-digital-financial-system&quot;&gt;The Emergence of a Digital Financial System&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first adopters of Ethereum were technologists experimenting with new mechanisms for ownership and coordination. Most of the culture and products were created for themselves. Over time, a broader range of actors began using the system for financial services.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most consequential development has been the rise of stablecoins, digital representations of fiat currency backed by real world assets. Their combined market capitalization exceeds three hundred billion dollars, with a majority circulating on Ethereum. Transaction volumes on blockchain networks now approach those processed by major payment systems.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stablecoins replicate core financial functions such as store of value and transfer of funds without geographic restrictions and with continuous settlement. Their programmability enabled the construction of lending protocols that allow users to lend and borrow assets with risk parameters enforced in software rather than through institutional mediation.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These systems differ from traditional financial infrastructure. Participation is global rather than jurisdictional. Switching costs are low because services are built on interoperable standards. Exit is immediate. Risk is transparent though often misunderstood.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compare that to countries like Argentina, where interoperability between banks and fintech wallets, something as trivial as scanning a QR code, is still an ongoing regulatory battle. Incumbents try to use their market position to avoid being interoperable. On Ethereum, interoperability is structural. Individuals can receive payment, convert assets, provide liquidity and borrow collateralized funds within minutes from a mobile device. In legacy systems, similar transactions take days and incur high fees. Adoption reflects demand for neutral infrastructure in environments where intermediation is unreliable.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;implications&quot;&gt;Implications&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several areas of financial activity are migrating to blockchain based systems, including remittances, trade finance and private credit. Others, such as corporate debt markets, remain fragmented and costly but exhibit characteristics that may make them suitable for digital reconstruction on top of Ethereum.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Significant obstacles remain. Regulatory uncertainty, operational risk and user experience challenges constrain adoption. Scaling transaction throughput without compromising decentralization is an engineering problem that has not been solved conclusively. Software vulnerabilities and governance failures present meaningful risk.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These challenges appear tractable. Early evidence suggests that elements of financial intermediation can be automated at lower cost and with greater transparency than existing systems. The trajectory of adoption will depend on institutional responses as much as technical progress.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;artificial-intelligence-and-coordination&quot;&gt;Artificial Intelligence and Coordination&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Artificial intelligence increases productive capacity by automating tasks but does not resolve questions of ownership, governance or compliance. Output may be generated more efficiently, but disputes over entitlement, liability and compensation persist.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Artificial intelligence and blockchains, but in particular Ethereum, are the two biggest innovations in the decades to come. The two technologies solve concrete core primitives of humans: productivity gains and coordination. Artificial intelligence will make people more productive, but it will not eliminate the bureaucratic machinery required to verify and enforce outcomes. Ethereum introduces a technology that complements AI: a system where humans and autonomous agents can coordinate, trade, and settle disputes directly through code, without relying on institutions to prove that everyone followed the rules.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The internet lowered the cost of transmitting information but did not create institutions for defining and enforcing rights over digital assets. The result has been an economy coordinated by private platforms rather than neutral systems of governance. Ethereum reconstructs elements of property rights and contractual enforcement as public infrastructure encoded in software.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether such systems become core infrastructure or remain specialized instruments will depend on institutional adaptation, regulation and technological progress. They have already demonstrated an alternative cost structure for financial coordination and introduced mechanisms for digital property that do not rely on centralized administration.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The internet built an economy without institutions. Ethereum is an attempt to build them.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <description xml:base="https://federicocarrone.com/articles/crypto-doctrine/">&lt;h1 id=&quot;crypto-and-the-21st-century&quot;&gt;Crypto and the 21st Century&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe crypto has been incredibly successful at providing a trustless financial layer for the 21st century. In particular it has found product market fit in two main areas:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In developing countries providing aids and tools to individuals that need to fight against inflation, censorship and for companies and individuals to be able to business.
Internet native communities that need a financial layer in the web that allows them to express and coordinate at a scale that wasn’t possible before. They have created new financial assets and markets that seem absurd from outside. Many times they are also absurd from the inside.
People that don’t live in a developing country or that didn’t grow up with the internet have enormous difficulties understanding crypto because they don’t have skin in its game. They believe crypto doesn’t have any “real” use case or that is not serious enough. They are right. The thing is that we are living in a world that’s is becoming more absurd. Memes do not only make you laugh anymore, memes are now winning elections.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re sure that these two use cases will grow with time and probably new ones will be found. The world is becoming more chaotic and more divided each day. The stability that existed since the fall of the Soviet Union and the beginning of the pandemic appears to have become a thing of the past. Only change will become the norm. And we love it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will make crypto even bigger. One of its prime advantages is that it kills many of the middlemen and allow us to coordinate even in the harshest environments. Trust assumptions are lowered thanks to economic incentives, compilers, distributed systems and cryptography. Crypto lowers the reliance on human beings. This empowers humans. It allows them to concentrate their disputes and efforts in subjectives areas. Crypto creates safe zones where some parts of the human activity becomes non-debatable (until quantum computers solve the discrete log problem).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of us are internet natives. We have been using irc, 4chan, reddit, hacker news, twitter, Bitcoin and Ethereum since their beginning and our organization has deep roots in unstable countries. In our roots we have a strange mix of knowing what it is to live in very chaotic societies and how to develop businesses within them and at the same time we are builders that love working in the frontier of engineering and scientific developments. We are the Fremen of crypto, raised in a harsh environment.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open source and decentralization are not only philosophical ideas but necessary practical conditions to build crypto. Building in the open, helping onboard others and creating movements bigger than the original project are crucial for crypto projects to succeed long term. Sometimes it’s difficult for us to explain our actions to others that don’t follow the same ethos since we are not maximizing the same outcomes.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our main objective is to help these new internet highways to be built in sustainable ways. Economic sustainability is one key aspect but there are others. We are a force that builds large technological projects but that also counterweights the natural tendency to centralize as a side effect of optimization. Centralization is easier and cheaper in the short run.  If we would want to optimize money, there are easier ways to do it. The thing is that is not our main objective. We only see money as a tool to achieve our objectives.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With or without money you will find us building. You are invited to join us in our journey.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <description xml:base="https://federicocarrone.com/articles/transforming-the-future-with-zero-knowledge-proofs-fully-homomorphic-encryption-and-new-distributed-systems-algorithms/">&lt;p&gt;The evolution of every scientific discipline or engineering field experiences cycles akin to those observed in economies. Incremental advancements are made daily by corporations, individuals, and academic institutions. Occasionally, a researcher or engineer makes a groundbreaking discovery that alters the course of the field. One such example is Sir Isaac Newton, who made significant contributions to calculus, motion, optics, and gravitation during the time of the bubonic plague, which claimed millions of lives. His relentless pursuit of knowledge throughout the pandemic proved instrumental in shaping the development of mathematics, physics, and engineering. Our comfortable modern lives stand upon the foundation of these monumental discoveries.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The general public is aware of the big breakthroughs made in the aerospatial industry, energy production, internet of things, and last but not least artificial intelligence. However, most don’t know that during the COVID pandemic, enormous advances were made in cryptography. 47 years ago Diffie and Hellman wrote in their famous cryptography paper: “we stand today on the brink of a revolution in cryptography”, which enabled two people to exchange confidential information even when they can only communicate via a channel monitored by an adversary. This revolution enabled electronic commerce and the communication between citizens of the free world. We believe the discoveries made by researchers and engineers in cryptography during this COVID pandemic will be as important as the discoveries made by Diffie and Hellman in the upcoming decades.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the big discoveries has been how to make Zero-Knowledge Proofs fast enough for real-world applications. This technology has been around since 1984 but as Diffie also said, “Lots of people working in cryptography have no deep concern with real application issues. They are trying to discover things clever enough to write papers about”. Fortunately for humanity, researchers and engineers have made this technology practical enough in the last decade (especially the last 2 years) to be useful.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The financial system depends on the existence of intermediaries: an army of auditors, regulators, and accountants. The correct working of the financial machine depends on the integrity of its financial institutions. Integrity is maintained due to positive economic incentives and jail time, fines, and costly lawsuits if the intermediaries don’t do what the state and society expect from them. Bitcoin, a result of the 2008 crisis, created a permissionless financial system where its users can send and receive digital money without intermediaries and without anybody being able to block transactions. In countries like Argentina, Nigeria, or Lebanon, where stagnation and inflation erode its citizens&#x27; trust in the financial system and the state, Bitcoin and stablecoins on top of Ethereum are used on a daily basis by the young population to save and avoid capital controls. In developed countries, its usage is not as massive since the traditional financial system and the state is trusted by most citizens. However, the world is becoming more complex. Banks are failing in the US and Europe, a new war is taking place in Europe, debt levels are not sustainable in many countries, the fight between left and the right is retaking the main stage, tension between the West and the East increases, and technological change keeps accelerating.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New applications built on top of unstoppable and trustless technologies that don’t depend on social trust will grow and thrive in this type of environment. Everything is being questioned. Only things that can’t be questioned will fully resist the passage of time. This will happen not only in developing countries but also in developed ones. Systems like Bitcoin, where everyone can verify how it’s running, are more resilient and become more useful by the day in a world that is getting more complex.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin&#x27;s focus has been to become a new type of monetary asset and financial network. For this reason, the development of more complex programs on top of Bitcoin has always been restricted by design. Newer blockchains like Ethereum added the ability to create new types of applications. DeFi Protocols that enabled lending and borrowing, exchange of digital currencies and the ability to buy, sell and trade digital collectives and arts rapidly grew on top of Ethereum. However the cost of creating and transferring relevant amounts of assets in blockchains is costly. The ability to create more complex applications that sit on top of blockchains is also very limited. Applications can’t run more than a few milliseconds on Ethereum.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These systems do not rely on social integrity like traditional systems. Instead, they operate as a permissionless and censorship-resistant network, allowing anyone to add a node and submit updates to its state. To ensure verification, each node must re-execute all transactions, which makes the system decentralized and secure, albeit slower than centralized systems. Consequently, this imposes a limitation on the types of applications that can be built on blockchains. Applications requiring frequent database state updates, such as those exceeding a few times per second, or machine learning algorithms, are not feasible on blockchain platforms.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) and other cryptographic and distributed systems primitives will help society create tools that can be used by everyone. ZKPs enable a party to demonstrate a statement to other parties without revealing any information beyond the proof. In more concrete terms, this enables a person to show another person that the computation they did is correct without having to redo it and without even having to grant access to the data that was used. An important aspect of this is that the verification is done in a much faster time than the proving. In even simpler terms, it proves that the output of a certain computation is correct. The verification is way easier and faster to do than the execution or proving. Anybody can check the proof, and this saves computing time and money.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the beginning it’s difficult to grasp, even for engineers, that such a technology is even possible. The mathematics behind it, until recently, seemed magical, and that’s why it was called moon math. Thanks to ZKPs, transferring money in blockchains similar to Bitcoin is cheaper and way faster since there is no need to re-execute each transaction by each node. Only one node is needed to process all the transactions and prove them using a ZKPs, while the rest simply need to verify it, saving valuable computing resources. Among other things, ZKPs enable creating a financial system that doesn’t depend on social trust like traditional finance and that doesn’t depend as much on re-executing algorithms as Bitcoin.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zero Knowledge Proofs facilitate the development of an entirely new range of applications that are executed and proven on a single computer outside the blockchain, with verification occurring within Ethereum. The verification cost is way cheaper than the time it takes to prove or execute it. Ethereum will evolve from a slow yet secure distributed mainframe, where execution time is shared among all users to run small programs, into a distributed computer that stores and verifies proofs generated externally from the blockchain.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only will blockchains benefit from the development of new cryptographic primitives like Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs), but other areas will also be significantly impacted. As AI-generated content begins to overshadow human-generated content on the internet, ZKPs will become essential for verifying that such content was produced by unbiased AI models. &quot;Proof of humanity&quot; systems are already employing ZKPs to ensure the accurate computation of a human accessing specific resources.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hardware is another area where ZKPs will make an impact. Similar to how graphics cards in the 1990s revolutionized the video game industry, zero-knowledge hardware acceleration will be integrated into computers to enhance efficiency.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZKPs can also be utilized to balance storage and computation securely. For instance, security cameras generate vast amounts of data. ZKPs can provide a compact proof that AI models did not detect any critical information in the video, allowing the system to delete the footage and save storage space.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZKPs will even be used for national security purposes. As energy production shifts from centralized power plants to distributed sources like solar panels and wind turbines, verifying the proper execution of software on their controllers becomes vital. In the coming decades, ZKPs will play a crucial role in securing these devices.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Software industry regulations are inevitable, and industries such as online casinos and ad networks using Real-Time Bidding protocols will be legally required to demonstrate that they have not deceived their clients. Laws protecting users from large tech corporations are already in place in Europe, partly due to concerns about data misuse by foreign powers to influence political campaigns.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Requirements for secure storage and processing of encrypted data will become increasingly necessary. Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), a technology akin to ZKPs, will be one of the tools utilized for this purpose. FHE enables computation on encrypted data, ensuring privacy. As FHE becomes more efficient and practical, most databases will integrate some FHE functionality, preventing administrators from accessing user data directly.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), which generate evidence for a third party to confirm the accurate execution of a computation, and Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), which enables calculations on encrypted data, will be combined with distributed systems algorithms that are capable of tolerating significant network failures similar to those employed by Bitcoin. Together they will be utilized to comply with regulations while creating trustless applications.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past decade, we have successfully launched applications serving dozens of millions of users. Leveraging our expertise, we are now dedicated to providing both technical and financial support to help others create startups focused on developing and implementing these vital technologies. As society grapples with the challenges of our rapidly evolving world these innovations will prove to be indispensable.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
