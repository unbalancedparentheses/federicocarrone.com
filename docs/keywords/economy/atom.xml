        <content type="html" xml:base="https://federicocarrone.com/articles/ethereum-is-the-new-financial-backend-of-the-world/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By Federico Carrone and Roberto Catalan&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ethereum is emerging as a general purpose financial backend that reduces the cost and complexity of building financial services while improving their speed and security. For decades the internet accelerated communication but did not create a neutral system for defining ownership or enforcing obligations. Economic activity moved online without the accompanying machinery of rights, records, and jurisdiction. Ethereum fills this gap by embedding these functions in software and enforcing them through a distributed validator set.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Markets depend on property rights, and property rights depend on reliable systems for recording ownership, supporting transfer, and enforcing obligations. Prices then communicate scarcity and preference, enabling coordination at scale. Technological progress has repeatedly lowered the cost of transmitting information and synchronizing action. Ethereum extends this pattern by lowering the cost of establishing and verifying ownership across borders.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;from-internet-native-to-global-infrastructure&quot;&gt;From internet native to global infrastructure&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ethereum’s early innovation was the introduction of programmable digital assets with defined economic properties. Issuers could establish monetary rules, engineer scarcity, and integrate assets into applications. Before Ethereum, such experimentation required constructing a  network and persuading others to secure it, a process limited to technically sophisticated groups. Ethereum replaced infrastructure duplication with shared security and a general purpose environment, turning issuance from a capital intensive undertaking into a software driven activity.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more consequential development has been the recognition that Ethereum can reconstruct traditional financial services in a form that is more transparent and less operationally burdensome. Financial institutions devote substantial resources to authorization, accounting, monitoring, dispute resolution, and reporting. Consumer interfaces sit atop complex internal systems designed to prevent error and misconduct. Ethereum substitutes a portion of this apparatus with a shared ledger, a programmable execution environment, and cryptographic enforcement. Administrative complexity is reduced because core functions are delegated to software rather than replicated within each institution.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ethereum reduces that burden by providing a shared ledger with real time updates, a programmable space for defining rules, and cryptographic enforcement. It does not remove institutions but changes which parts of the financial stack they must build themselves. Issuance becomes simpler, custody more secure, and administration less dependent on proprietary infrastructure.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;software-trust-and-the-reduction-of-friction&quot;&gt;Software, trust and the reduction of friction&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some economists describe transaction costs through three frictions: triangulation, transfer and trust. Triangulation concerns how economic actors identify each other and agree on terms. Transfer concerns how value moves between them. Trust concerns the enforcement of obligations. Traditional financial architecture manages these frictions through scale, proprietary systems, and coordination among intermediaries.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ethereum remove middlemen and therefore lowers the three frictions enumerated before. Open marketplaces support discovery of assets and prices. Digital value can settle globally within minutes without the layers of correspondent banking. Obligations can be executed automatically and verified publicly. These capabilities do not eliminate institutional functions but shift part of the work from organizations to software, reducing cost and operational risk.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New entrants benefit immediately. They can rely on infrastructure maintained by thousands of engineers rather than building their own systems for settlement, custody, and enforcement. Business logic becomes code. Obligations can be automated. Settlement becomes immediate. Users retain custody. This expands the range of viable business models and allows firms to serve markets that incumbents consider too small or too complex.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having a single global ledger also changes operational dynamics. Many institutions operate multiple databases that require frequent reconciliation and remain vulnerable to error. Ethereum maintains a continuously updated and replicated record that cannot be amended retroactively. Redundancy and recoverability become default properties rather than costly internal functions.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Security follows the same pattern. Instead of defending a central database, Ethereum distributes verification among many independent actors. Altering history requires coordination at scale and becomes prohibitively expensive. Confidence arises from system design rather than institutional promises.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;new-financial-services-and-global-reach&quot;&gt;New financial services and global reach&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These features enable services that resemble established financial activities but operate with different cost structures. International transfers can use digital dollars rather than correspondent networks. Loans can enforce collateral rules in code. Local payment systems can interoperate without proprietary standards. Individuals in unstable economies can store value in digital instruments independent of local monetary fragility.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearing, custody, reconciliation, monitoring, and enforcement shift from organizational processes into shared software. Companies can focus on product design and distribution rather than maintaining complex internal infrastructure. Scale is achieved by acquiring users, because infrastructure is shared. Value accrues to applications rather than to duplicated internal systems.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The impact is most visible in markets with fragile financial systems. In economies with unstable currencies or slow payment networks, Ethereum provides immediate functional gains. In developed markets the benefits appear incremental but accumulate as more instruments and processes become programmable.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;institutional-transformation-and-long-term-dynamics&quot;&gt;Institutional transformation and long term dynamics&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many financial instruments are heterogeneous. Corporate debt is a clear example. Terms differ by maturity, coupon, covenants, collateral, and risk. Trading depends on bilateral negotiation and intermediaries who maintain records and enforce obligations. Ethereum can represent these instruments digitally, track ownership, and execute terms automatically. Contracts retain their specificity, while administration becomes standardized and interoperable.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This suggests a shift in institutional architecture. Regulation and legal systems remain central, but the boundary between what firms must build and what software can enforce changes. Institutions evolve from infrastructure providers to service designers. Cost structures diverge between firms that maintain legacy systems and those that rely on shared infrastructure.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ethereum already functions as an alternative financial rail. Its reliability, the presence of multiple independently developed clients, substantial real world usage, active research community, and commitment to openness and verification distinguish it from other blockchain networks. These qualities align with the requirements of durable financial infrastructure.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ethereum converts core financial frictions into software functions. This changes the economics of building and operating financial services. Talent and capital shift from operations to innovation in product design. Institutions become lighter and more focused. Those who will adopt Ethereum will have lower costs of operation and will have a head start against competitors.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technological transitions begin in niches where incumbents do not meet demand. As systems mature, costs fall and broader adoption becomes feasible. Ethereum followed this path. It began with internet native communities, expanded across emerging markets where users lacked reliable financial tools, and is now positioned to upgrade mainstream markets by making financial companies easier to create and operate.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The broader implication is that software is becoming the organizing principle of financial infrastructure. Ethereum makes this shift concrete. Whether it becomes foundational will depend on regulation and institutional adaptation, but the economic incentives are increasingly aligned with systems that are open, verifiable, and resilient.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://federicocarrone.com/articles/the-missing-institution-of-the-internet-ethereum/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By Federico Carrone and Roberto Catalan&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern economic systems rest on two foundations: tools that expand productive capacity and institutions that define who controls their output. The internet transformed how information moves, but it did not reconstruct the institutional machinery that governs ownership and exchange. Digital economic life therefore expanded without a durable system of rights, enforcement, or jurisdiction. Blockchain networks, and Ethereum in particular, address this gap by embedding institutional functions in software and enforcing them through economic incentives and cryptographic verification.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;technology-culture-and-institutional-design&quot;&gt;Technology, Culture and Institutional Design&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In most species, behavior is shaped by biology and fixed through genetic inheritance. Humans diverged by inventing technologies that alter their environment more rapidly than biological evolution can adapt to it. Fire, agriculture, medicine and computing enabled a physically vulnerable species to extend its productive frontiers.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equally significant was the emergence of institutions that facilitated cooperation beyond small groups. Human societies are organized not through inherited instinct but through constructed systems of norms, laws and symbolic abstractions that can be revised in response to changing conditions. Cultural evolution permits continuous redesign and operates on a faster timescale than genetic change.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This dual process, technological augmentation and institutional invention, generated compounding effects. Tools expanded individual capacity and institutions aggregated that capacity into collective action. Property rights, contracts, markets and corporate entities emerged as mechanisms to coordinate behavior at scale by defining entitlements and aligning incentives.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;property-rights-and-markets-as-social-technologies&quot;&gt;Property Rights and Markets as Social Technologies&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Economic development depends not only on productive capability but on credible commitments. Individuals and firms invest when they can expect to benefit from their efforts and be protected from arbitrary interference. Property rights provide that assurance by specifying ownership, use and exclusion. Markets, layered on top of these rights, coordinate production and exchange by allocating resources through price signals.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These arrangements are often treated as natural features of economic life. They are engineered agreements constructed through law and political settlement. Their value lies in enabling investment, specialization and trade under uncertainty. Prices, money and contracts compress information about scarcity, preferences and risk, enabling production to be coordinated across large populations without centralized direction.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The global expansion of trade in the twentieth century reflected these institutional foundations. Specialization increased productivity and interdependence reduced conflict by raising the cost of disruption. Innovations such as neutral jurisdictions and corporate structures enabled strangers to transact under shared rules. Legal entities functioned as containers that allowed participants from different regulatory environments to collaborate.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This infrastructure, whether admired or criticized, underwrote the international economic order of the late twentieth century.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-missing-architecture-of-digital-ownership&quot;&gt;The Missing Architecture of Digital Ownership&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The internet lowered the cost of communication and commerce across borders, but it did not establish a neutral mechanism for defining and enforcing claims on digital assets. Offline, ownership is adjudicated by courts, enforced by states and geographically bounded. Online, in the absence of a global authority, ownership defaults to either national legal systems or to the platforms that mediate activity.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corporations filled this vacuum by providing infrastructure for identity, communication and exchange. They set terms of access, mediate transactions and retain discretionary control over assets generated within their systems. Users and firms may create content, build businesses and accumulate value, but their rights are contingent on the policies of the platform operator.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The experience of Zynga illustrates this dynamic. The company developed a profitable games business on Facebook and briefly achieved a valuation exceeding that of Electronic Arts. Its fortunes deteriorated when Facebook revised its policies and altered its revenue share. Zynga owned its intellectual property and its infrastructure but not the environment on which its business model depended, a common position for firms built on platform economies. In digital markets, platforms function as de facto landlords.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not an isolated case but a structural feature of platform centered economies: extensive participation paired with limited control.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;ethereum-as-an-institutional-experiment&quot;&gt;Ethereum as an Institutional Experiment&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ethereum is a response to this institutional absence. It provides a mechanism for creating, transferring and enforcing digital assets without reliance on corporate or national intermediaries. The system operates as a verifiable computing environment in which rules are encoded in software and enforced collectively by a distributed network.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditional computing systems require users to trust the operator. Ethereum distributes computation across thousands of machines that execute identical code and verify each other in a continuous process. Outputs are accepted when consensus is reached and misbehavior is economically penalized. Under these conditions, property rights and contractual commitments can be represented as digital objects whose enforcement does not depend on courts or discretionary authority.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This architecture automates functions normally performed by institutions. Auditors repeat financial records to detect manipulation. Courts resolve disputes. Regulators impose compliance standards. These systems are essential but costly and slow. Ethereum replicates aspects of verification and enforcement at the system level using software, mathematics and economic incentives.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The network is open to participation without authorization and resistant to censorship because no single entity can unilaterally block or rewrite transactions. These properties arise from the structure of the system rather than ideological intent.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-emergence-of-a-digital-financial-system&quot;&gt;The Emergence of a Digital Financial System&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first adopters of Ethereum were technologists experimenting with new mechanisms for ownership and coordination. Most of the culture and products were created for themselves. Over time, a broader range of actors began using the system for financial services.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most consequential development has been the rise of stablecoins, digital representations of fiat currency backed by real world assets. Their combined market capitalization exceeds three hundred billion dollars, with a majority circulating on Ethereum. Transaction volumes on blockchain networks now approach those processed by major payment systems.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stablecoins replicate core financial functions such as store of value and transfer of funds without geographic restrictions and with continuous settlement. Their programmability enabled the construction of lending protocols that allow users to lend and borrow assets with risk parameters enforced in software rather than through institutional mediation.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These systems differ from traditional financial infrastructure. Participation is global rather than jurisdictional. Switching costs are low because services are built on interoperable standards. Exit is immediate. Risk is transparent though often misunderstood.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compare that to countries like Argentina, where interoperability between banks and fintech wallets, something as trivial as scanning a QR code, is still an ongoing regulatory battle. Incumbents try to use their market position to avoid being interoperable. On Ethereum, interoperability is structural. Individuals can receive payment, convert assets, provide liquidity and borrow collateralized funds within minutes from a mobile device. In legacy systems, similar transactions take days and incur high fees. Adoption reflects demand for neutral infrastructure in environments where intermediation is unreliable.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;implications&quot;&gt;Implications&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several areas of financial activity are migrating to blockchain based systems, including remittances, trade finance and private credit. Others, such as corporate debt markets, remain fragmented and costly but exhibit characteristics that may make them suitable for digital reconstruction on top of Ethereum.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Significant obstacles remain. Regulatory uncertainty, operational risk and user experience challenges constrain adoption. Scaling transaction throughput without compromising decentralization is an engineering problem that has not been solved conclusively. Software vulnerabilities and governance failures present meaningful risk.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These challenges appear tractable. Early evidence suggests that elements of financial intermediation can be automated at lower cost and with greater transparency than existing systems. The trajectory of adoption will depend on institutional responses as much as technical progress.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;artificial-intelligence-and-coordination&quot;&gt;Artificial Intelligence and Coordination&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Artificial intelligence increases productive capacity by automating tasks but does not resolve questions of ownership, governance or compliance. Output may be generated more efficiently, but disputes over entitlement, liability and compensation persist.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Artificial intelligence and blockchains, but in particular Ethereum, are the two biggest innovations in the decades to come. The two technologies solve concrete core primitives of humans: productivity gains and coordination. Artificial intelligence will make people more productive, but it will not eliminate the bureaucratic machinery required to verify and enforce outcomes. Ethereum introduces a technology that complements AI: a system where humans and autonomous agents can coordinate, trade, and settle disputes directly through code, without relying on institutions to prove that everyone followed the rules.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The internet lowered the cost of transmitting information but did not create institutions for defining and enforcing rights over digital assets. The result has been an economy coordinated by private platforms rather than neutral systems of governance. Ethereum reconstructs elements of property rights and contractual enforcement as public infrastructure encoded in software.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether such systems become core infrastructure or remain specialized instruments will depend on institutional adaptation, regulation and technological progress. They have already demonstrated an alternative cost structure for financial coordination and introduced mechanisms for digital property that do not rely on centralized administration.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The internet built an economy without institutions. Ethereum is an attempt to build them.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
