          <description xml:base="https://federicocarrone.com/articles/the-missing-institution-of-the-internet-ethereum/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By Federico Carrone and Roberto Catalan&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern economic systems rest on two foundations: tools that expand productive capacity and institutions that define who controls their output. The internet transformed how information moves, but it did not reconstruct the institutional machinery that governs ownership and exchange. Digital economic life therefore expanded without a durable system of rights, enforcement, or jurisdiction. Blockchain networks, and Ethereum in particular, address this gap by embedding institutional functions in software and enforcing them through economic incentives and cryptographic verification.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;technology-culture-and-institutional-design&quot;&gt;Technology, Culture and Institutional Design&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In most species, behavior is shaped by biology and fixed through genetic inheritance. Humans diverged by inventing technologies that alter their environment more rapidly than biological evolution can adapt to it. Fire, agriculture, medicine and computing enabled a physically vulnerable species to extend its productive frontiers.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equally significant was the emergence of institutions that facilitated cooperation beyond small groups. Human societies are organized not through inherited instinct but through constructed systems of norms, laws and symbolic abstractions that can be revised in response to changing conditions. Cultural evolution permits continuous redesign and operates on a faster timescale than genetic change.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This dual process, technological augmentation and institutional invention, generated compounding effects. Tools expanded individual capacity and institutions aggregated that capacity into collective action. Property rights, contracts, markets and corporate entities emerged as mechanisms to coordinate behavior at scale by defining entitlements and aligning incentives.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;property-rights-and-markets-as-social-technologies&quot;&gt;Property Rights and Markets as Social Technologies&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Economic development depends not only on productive capability but on credible commitments. Individuals and firms invest when they can expect to benefit from their efforts and be protected from arbitrary interference. Property rights provide that assurance by specifying ownership, use and exclusion. Markets, layered on top of these rights, coordinate production and exchange by allocating resources through price signals.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These arrangements are often treated as natural features of economic life. They are engineered agreements constructed through law and political settlement. Their value lies in enabling investment, specialization and trade under uncertainty. Prices, money and contracts compress information about scarcity, preferences and risk, enabling production to be coordinated across large populations without centralized direction.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The global expansion of trade in the twentieth century reflected these institutional foundations. Specialization increased productivity and interdependence reduced conflict by raising the cost of disruption. Innovations such as neutral jurisdictions and corporate structures enabled strangers to transact under shared rules. Legal entities functioned as containers that allowed participants from different regulatory environments to collaborate.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This infrastructure, whether admired or criticized, underwrote the international economic order of the late twentieth century.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-missing-architecture-of-digital-ownership&quot;&gt;The Missing Architecture of Digital Ownership&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The internet lowered the cost of communication and commerce across borders, but it did not establish a neutral mechanism for defining and enforcing claims on digital assets. Offline, ownership is adjudicated by courts, enforced by states and geographically bounded. Online, in the absence of a global authority, ownership defaults to either national legal systems or to the platforms that mediate activity.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corporations filled this vacuum by providing infrastructure for identity, communication and exchange. They set terms of access, mediate transactions and retain discretionary control over assets generated within their systems. Users and firms may create content, build businesses and accumulate value, but their rights are contingent on the policies of the platform operator.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The experience of Zynga illustrates this dynamic. The company developed a profitable games business on Facebook and briefly achieved a valuation exceeding that of Electronic Arts. Its fortunes deteriorated when Facebook revised its policies and altered its revenue share. Zynga owned its intellectual property and its infrastructure but not the environment on which its business model depended, a common position for firms built on platform economies. In digital markets, platforms function as de facto landlords.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not an isolated case but a structural feature of platform centered economies: extensive participation paired with limited control.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;ethereum-as-an-institutional-experiment&quot;&gt;Ethereum as an Institutional Experiment&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ethereum is a response to this institutional absence. It provides a mechanism for creating, transferring and enforcing digital assets without reliance on corporate or national intermediaries. The system operates as a verifiable computing environment in which rules are encoded in software and enforced collectively by a distributed network.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditional computing systems require users to trust the operator. Ethereum distributes computation across thousands of machines that execute identical code and verify each other in a continuous process. Outputs are accepted when consensus is reached and misbehavior is economically penalized. Under these conditions, property rights and contractual commitments can be represented as digital objects whose enforcement does not depend on courts or discretionary authority.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This architecture automates functions normally performed by institutions. Auditors repeat financial records to detect manipulation. Courts resolve disputes. Regulators impose compliance standards. These systems are essential but costly and slow. Ethereum replicates aspects of verification and enforcement at the system level using software, mathematics and economic incentives.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The network is open to participation without authorization and resistant to censorship because no single entity can unilaterally block or rewrite transactions. These properties arise from the structure of the system rather than ideological intent.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-emergence-of-a-digital-financial-system&quot;&gt;The Emergence of a Digital Financial System&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first adopters of Ethereum were technologists experimenting with new mechanisms for ownership and coordination. Most of the culture and products were created for themselves. Over time, a broader range of actors began using the system for financial services.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most consequential development has been the rise of stablecoins, digital representations of fiat currency backed by real world assets. Their combined market capitalization exceeds three hundred billion dollars, with a majority circulating on Ethereum. Transaction volumes on blockchain networks now approach those processed by major payment systems.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stablecoins replicate core financial functions such as store of value and transfer of funds without geographic restrictions and with continuous settlement. Their programmability enabled the construction of lending protocols that allow users to lend and borrow assets with risk parameters enforced in software rather than through institutional mediation.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These systems differ from traditional financial infrastructure. Participation is global rather than jurisdictional. Switching costs are low because services are built on interoperable standards. Exit is immediate. Risk is transparent though often misunderstood.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compare that to countries like Argentina, where interoperability between banks and fintech wallets, something as trivial as scanning a QR code, is still an ongoing regulatory battle. Incumbents try to use their market position to avoid being interoperable. On Ethereum, interoperability is structural. Individuals can receive payment, convert assets, provide liquidity and borrow collateralized funds within minutes from a mobile device. In legacy systems, similar transactions take days and incur high fees. Adoption reflects demand for neutral infrastructure in environments where intermediation is unreliable.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;implications&quot;&gt;Implications&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several areas of financial activity are migrating to blockchain based systems, including remittances, trade finance and private credit. Others, such as corporate debt markets, remain fragmented and costly but exhibit characteristics that may make them suitable for digital reconstruction on top of Ethereum.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Significant obstacles remain. Regulatory uncertainty, operational risk and user experience challenges constrain adoption. Scaling transaction throughput without compromising decentralization is an engineering problem that has not been solved conclusively. Software vulnerabilities and governance failures present meaningful risk.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These challenges appear tractable. Early evidence suggests that elements of financial intermediation can be automated at lower cost and with greater transparency than existing systems. The trajectory of adoption will depend on institutional responses as much as technical progress.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;artificial-intelligence-and-coordination&quot;&gt;Artificial Intelligence and Coordination&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Artificial intelligence increases productive capacity by automating tasks but does not resolve questions of ownership, governance or compliance. Output may be generated more efficiently, but disputes over entitlement, liability and compensation persist.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Artificial intelligence and blockchains, but in particular Ethereum, are the two biggest innovations in the decades to come. The two technologies solve concrete core primitives of humans: productivity gains and coordination. Artificial intelligence will make people more productive, but it will not eliminate the bureaucratic machinery required to verify and enforce outcomes. Ethereum introduces a technology that complements AI: a system where humans and autonomous agents can coordinate, trade, and settle disputes directly through code, without relying on institutions to prove that everyone followed the rules.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The internet lowered the cost of transmitting information but did not create institutions for defining and enforcing rights over digital assets. The result has been an economy coordinated by private platforms rather than neutral systems of governance. Ethereum reconstructs elements of property rights and contractual enforcement as public infrastructure encoded in software.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether such systems become core infrastructure or remain specialized instruments will depend on institutional adaptation, regulation and technological progress. They have already demonstrated an alternative cost structure for financial coordination and introduced mechanisms for digital property that do not rely on centralized administration.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The internet built an economy without institutions. Ethereum is an attempt to build them.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
